### Binding

In SwiftUI, the ``@Binding`` property wrapper is used to create a two-way connection between views. It allows a value to be passed from a parent view to a child view, and then any changes made to that value in the child view are propagated back to the parent view. This two-way binding simplifies the sharing and modification of data between different views.

Here's a simple example demonstrating the usage of ``@Binding``:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ParentView: View {
    @State private var isOn = false

    var body: some View {
        ChildView(isOn: $isOn)
    }
}

struct ChildView: View {
    @Binding var isOn: Bool

    var body: some View {
        Toggle("Toggle", isOn: $isOn)
    }
}
```

In this example, the ``isOn`` state property in ``ParentView`` is passed to ``ChildView`` using the ``@Binding`` property wrapper. This allows ``ChildView`` to modify the ``isOn`` value, and any changes made to it will be reflected in ``ParentView``. This illustrates the basic usage of the ``@Binding`` property wrapper in SwiftUI.
