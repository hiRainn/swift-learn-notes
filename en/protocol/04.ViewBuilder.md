### ViewBuilder
The ViewBuilder protocol is an attribute wrapper that combines multiple views into a single view. It allows us to create custom views containing multiple subviews in SwiftUI, making the code clearer and easier to read. With the ViewBuilder protocol, we can build a complex parent view using multiple child views without explicitly using view containers such as HStack, VStack, or ZStack. This makes it easier to organize and manage the view hierarchy, leading to more modular and maintainable code. 
Commonly used methods can be combined with extensions to create a subview method for View.

```Swift
extension View {
    @ViewBuiler
    func BuildNextViewBlock(_ alignment: Alignment) -> some view {
        self.frame(maxWidth: .infinity, alignment: alignment)
    }
}
```

```swift
struct Home: View {
    var body: some View {
        Vstack {
            HeaderView()
        }

        Hstack(content: {
            BodyView()
        })
    }
    @ViewBuiler
    func HeaderView() -> some View {
        ...
    }
    @ViewBuiler
    func BodyView() -> some View{
        ....
    }
}
```

Using @ViewBuilder provides the flexibility to combine multiple views in a single function and selectively return different views based on conditions, reducing code repetition and improving readability. On the other hand, directly writing additional struct :View requires creating extra structures, increasing code complexity and maintenance. Therefore, @ViewBuilder offers a more concise and flexible way to compose views.
